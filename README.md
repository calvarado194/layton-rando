A Professor Layton game randomizer

## What's this?
This is an ongoing project to develop a randomizer for Professor Layton games. So far, the initial build supports the PAL release of Professor Layton and the Curious Village and offers a simple puzzle shuffler. Get ready to tackle wifi weeklies, unused puzzle and bonus challenges on your way to find the mysterious Golden Apple!

## How to use
Once you've loaded your ROM, and as long as it is validated, the interface will ask for a seed and then generate the randomizer ROM for you to save. ROMs have been tested on DeSMume 0.9.2 and work. You can download the current builds for usage on Windows in our releases page.

## Contributing
The current build has been forked from [Tinke](https://github.com/pleonex/tinke) and we're open for help to add new features and compatibility with more Layton games.
